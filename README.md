This program makes use of multiple classes to print out three books I really liked! (Book 0 - test Object for constructor method)

Here is a quick test of the program:

Use Cases: 

 - Learning how to use multiple classes
 - Backend development with calling classes

Problems: 

 - I do not see any logical or runtime errors with this program.
